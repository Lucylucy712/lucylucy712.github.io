About me
======
I am currently a Model Risk Validator at Citigroup, specializing in Retail Risk & Consumer Valudation Models. In this role, I evaluate the soundness, regulatory compliance, and business relevance of Statistical Models and Machine Learning Models used in both customer acquisition and existing customer management strategies. 

I hold a Ph.D. in Statistics, with research focuse on applying deep learning to biomedical challenegs- specifically, predicting antimicrobial resistance at the genetic level using advanced deep learning algorithms. 

My expertise spans model validation, machine learning, statistical modeling, and data analysis. I am passionate about applying analytical methods to real-world problems, and Iâ€™m especially interested in advancing model risk governance, quantitative risk management, and AI-driven decision frameworks in financial services.

**I am seeking opportunities in Quantitative Risk or Model Development, particularly in Fixed Income, Credit Risk, or Market Risk domains.**
